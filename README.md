# Guess-the-number
I created a simple "Guess the Number" game using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 10, and your goal is to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game will tell you whether you were right or wrong. If your guess is incorrect, the score, starting at 10, will decrease by 1 for each wrong guess. The game continues until you either guess correctly or your score reaches zero. This project showcases my understanding of basic web development concepts, including the structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript).
